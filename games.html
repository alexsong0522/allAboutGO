    <p>In 1933, Go Seigen and Shusai played a famous game. Go Seigen was then 18 years old, ranked 5 dan, and been in Japan about five years. They had played before, but not an even game; Go Seigen had won five previous handicap games.

The tradition at the time dictated whoever played White had the right to adjourn the game at anytime, and there was no sealing of moves. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding White, could adjourn the game whenever it was his turn to play and continue deliberating at his leisure during the adjournment. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by calling adjournments some 13 times, without exception, all at his turn to move, thus prolonging the match to a period of three months (16 October 1933-19 January 1934). For instance, Shusai played first on the eighth day of the match, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes. Shusai then thought for three and a half hours but only to adjourn the game.

He trailed throughout the game until, on the 13th day of the match, he made a brilliant move at W160, now celebrated. It was rumored that it was not Shusai but one of his students, Maeda Nobuaki, who was the author of this ingenious move. Segoe Kensaku told a reporter this, in what he thought was an off-the-record interview.[3] Maeda himself even hinted as much. When presented with the opportunities to debunk these rumors, Maeda neither denied nor confirmed them.[4] The match ended with Honinbo Shusai winning by two points.</p>
